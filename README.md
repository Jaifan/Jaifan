### Hello and Welcome ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jafran Bin Zakaria

##### I'm a computer science graduate student who enjoys playing, learning, and building systems with code. During the study period, I was primarily focused on Data Structure and Algorithms. After that, I focused on the development side of the web. I have more than two years of coding experience in web technologies. I build some systems such as APIs, and user-interface with modern technologies. And still try learning something new such as Blockchain, Decentralized & NFTs, etc technologies.
